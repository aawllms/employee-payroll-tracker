for loops 



3 functions 

collectEmployees()

displayAverageSalary function - calculate average salary and log info - template literal    log salaries with no and with.2 outcomes, maybe use an if statement? 

getRandomEmployee - choose a random employee and log a template literal the first name and last name of employee 
Math.floor() and Math.Random

displayEmployees() - takes your array of objects and displays them in a table 

trackEmployeeData() - function we will trigger when the user takes the action of clicking on "Add Employees"
takes the array generated in collectEmployees function, sort the employees by last name and place them on a table using the displayEmployees() function.  this track employee function will execute the display average salary function to log average and it will execute the getRandomEmployee() function
